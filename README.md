DeRF (Detection Replay Framework) is an "Attacks As A Service" framework, allowing the emulation of offensive techniques and generation of repeatable detection samples from a UI - without the need for End Users to install software, use the CLI or possess credentials in the target environment.

## Deployment
DeRF is a framework for executing attacks and generating detection samples against resource an AWS account and GCP Project.  This framework is deployed across a targeted AWS Account and a GCP Project with Terraform. 
For more detailed instructions on deployment see [here](https://thederf.cloud/Deployment/derf-deployment/).

### Deployment Steps

1. Complete Prerequisites - see [Prerequisites](https://thederf.cloud/Deployment/derf-deployment/#prerequisites).
2. Complete System Requirements - see [System Requirements](https://thederf.cloud/Deployment/derf-deployment/#system-requirements).
3. Clone the Github repo to your local system.   
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/vectra-ai-research/derf.git
        ```
4. Deploy The DeRF via Terraform from the `./env-prod` directory.  
        ```
        export AWS_PROFILE=PROFILE 
        ```  
        ```
        terraform init -backend-config=derf.conf
        ```    
        ```
        terraform plan -var-file=derf.tfvars
        ```   
        ```
        terraform apply -var-file=derf.tfvars
        ```   


## Attack Execution
Attack execution targeting both AWS and GCP is performed by invoking a Google Cloud Workflow. Workflows can be invoked either on the Google Cloud Console or programmatically with the `gcloud cli`

### Executing Attacks on the Console
1. Log into the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/workflows/) and and navigate to the workflows page.
2. Click on the name of the workflow that matches the attack you want to execute.

3. Click on the `EXECUTE` button.

4. Refer to the Code panel on the right-hand side and select which user to run the attack as by copying one of the possible inputs.

5. Paste selected json in the Input panel on the left-hand side.

6. Finally, select the `EXECUTE` button at the bottom of the screen.

The results of the attack will be displayed on the right-hand side of the screen.

### Executing Attacks Programmatically
1. Ensure the Google command line tool is installed locally.  Reference Google maintained [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) for instructions on installing `gcloud cli`
2. Authenticate to Google Cloud Project which DeRF is deployed
```
gcloud auth login --project PROJECT_ID
```
3. Invoke a particular attack techniques' workflow with the `gcloud cli`. See Google [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/workflows/run) for more complete instructions on the workflows service.

```
gcloud workflows run aws-ec2-get-user-data `--data={"user": "user01"}` 
```
